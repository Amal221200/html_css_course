# Heading Tags

The ```<h1>``` to ```<h6>``` HTML elements represent six levels of section headings. ```<h1>``` is the highest section level and ```<h6>``` is the lowest. By default, all heading elements create a block-level box in the layout, starting on a new line and taking up the full width available in their containing block.

Example:
```
    <h1>Heading One</h1>
    <h2>Heading Two</h2>
    <h3>Heading Three</h3>
    <h4>Heading Four</h4>
    <h5>Heading Five</h5>
    <h6>Heading Six</h6>
```
